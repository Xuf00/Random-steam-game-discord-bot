# Random Steam Game Bot #
A simple bot for discord to give a user a random game to play from their Steam profile. A user can also filter by games they've played or games they haven't yet played. Another feature is the capability of checking your most played or least played games.

See [Commands](#commands) for usages.

## Current version ## 
Works well but has a few additions I'd like to make.

Looking to add:
- General refactoring of code
- Speeding up the bots responses (Ties in with above)
- Fixing and handling errors that occasionally appear

## Hosting ##

The bot is now being hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. You can invite the bot to your server using this link:

## Donating ##

I don't really expect any donations as this is purely a project for fun and to find interesting gamees from my games list but putting this here in case you'd like to:
